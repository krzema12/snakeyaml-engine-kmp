/**
 * Returns the Unicode code point at the specified index.
 *
 * The `index` parameter is the regular `CharSequence` index, i.e. the number of `Char`s from the start of the character
 * sequence.
 *
 * If the code point at the specified index is part of the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), its value can be represented
 * using a single `Char` and this method will behave exactly like [CharSequence.get].
 * Code points outside the BMP are encoded using a surrogate pair â€“ a `Char` containing a value in the high surrogate
 * range followed by a `Char` containing a value in the low surrogate range. Together these two `Char`s encode a single
 * code point in one of the supplementary planes. This method will do the necessary decoding and return the value of
 * that single code point.
 *
 * In situations where surrogate characters are encountered that don't form a valid surrogate pair starting at `index`,
 * this method will return the surrogate code point itself, behaving like [CharSequence.get].
 *
 * If the `index` is out of bounds of this character sequence, this method throws an [IndexOutOfBoundsException].
 *
 * To iterate over all code points in a character sequence the index has to be adjusted depending on the value of the
 * returned code point. Use [CodePoints.charCount] for this.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Text containing code points outside the BMP (encoded as a surrogate pairs)
 * val text = "\uD83E\uDD95\uD83E\uDD96"
 *
 * var index = 0
 * while (index < text.length) {
 *     val codePoint = text.codePointAt(index)
 *     // Do something with codePoint
 *
 *     index += CodePoints.charCount(codePoint)
 * }
 * ```
